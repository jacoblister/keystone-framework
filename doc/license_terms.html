<h3><a name="Mission Statement"></a>Mission Statement</h3>

<p>The Keystone Application Framework exists to provide a high quality
architectural base on which to build software applications, available freely
to anyone.</p>

<p>It seeks to implement credible industry application standards in a fashion
which promotes reuse by software developers in applications, and chooses
<i>only</i> standards which are freely implementable, royalty and patent free</p>

<hr width="100%" size="2"/>

<h3><a name="Development History"></a>Development History</h3>

The Keystone Application framework has been developed as a combination of the
personal efforts of Jacob Lister, and development time sponsored by
Abbey Systems Wellington, his employer.

<h3><a name="License Terms"></a>License Terms</h3>

<h4>Intellectual Property</h4>

The Keystone Application Framework is the sole creation and intellectual
property of Jacob Lister.  It is hereby released as Free Software under the
terms of the Lesser General Public License, as defined by the
Free Software Foundation.  Though derived works of the framework are allowed
under the terms of the LGPL, Jacob Lister remains the administrator of the
official Keystone Application Framework release.

<h4>LGPL - GNU Lesser General Public License</h4>
<p>The Keystone Application Framework is released under the terms of the GNU
	Lesser General Public License.  The terms of this license may been read
<a href="reference/gnu_lesser.html">here</a>
</p>

<h4>Keystone LGPL Adaption</h4>

<p>The GNU Lesser General Public License is termed towards the licensing of
software libraries.  Application Frameworks may be considered as software
libraries, but the nature of their use requires a slightly different licensing
definition than that which is provided by the LGPL.</p>

<p>This sections modifies the terms of the LGPL to fit these needs.  It is the
intention of this license to fulfill the requirements of an Open Source
Definition license.</p>

<h5>'Derivative Works' Clarification</h5>

<p>The LGPL makes a distinction between a "work based on the library" and a
"work that uses the library" for the purposes of defining it's licensing terms.
Section 5 of the LGPL defines a "work that uses the library" as such</p>
<blockquote><i>
5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is
designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is
called a "work that uses the Library". Such a work, in isolation, is not a
derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this
License.
</i></blockquote>

<p>However, it is the nature of Application Frameworks that applications
reuse and extend classes defined in the base framework.  Any Application
Framework application is therefore by the LGPL definition a
"work based on the library".  This would require that the source to any such
application fall under the distribution terms of the LGPL.  This is not the
intent of this license</p>

<p>For the purposes of the Keystone Application Framework license, these LGPL
terms are redefined as follows:</p>
<p>a <b>"work based on the library"</b> is a derivative of the Application
Framework which is itself an Application Framework.  Such a work falls under
the same distribution terms as the original framework</p>
<p>a <b>"work which uses the library"</b> is a work which links with the
framework, but is not itself an Application Framework.  Such a work may be:
<ul>
	<li>A library, or a component (eg plug-in)</li>
	<li>An Application</li>
</ul>
</p>


<h5>Binary Distribution</h5>

<p>The LGPL requires that binary distributions of software built using the
licensed library in any way are provided with complete object code, or that it
is made easily available.  Many software producers may find this requirement
unworkable.  The license for the Keystone Application Framework therefor
modifies this requirement as follows:</p>

<blockquote><i>The resulting binary images of a "work which uses the library"
(A library, component or application) may be distributed under the software
producers own terms, without any of the additional requirements listed in
clause 6 of the GNU Lesser General Public License.</i></blockquote>
