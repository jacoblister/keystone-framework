<h3><a name="Open Standards Implemented"></a>Open Standards Implemented</h3>

<h4>W3C Standards</h4>
<p>The Keystone Application at least partially implements several open standards
published by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).  The W3C Patent Policy
Working Group states that (quote):</p>

<blockquote><i>"The W3C Patent Policy governs the handling of patents in the process of
producing Web standards. The goal of this policy is to assure that
Recommendations produced under this policy can be implemented on a
Royalty-Free (RF) basis."</i></blockquote>

<p>The official W3C Patent Policy may be read
<a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy">here</a></p>

The following W3C standards are at least partially implemented:

<ul>
<li>XML (Extensible Markup Language) - <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml">http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml</a></li>
<li>XPath (XML Path Language) - <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath">http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath</a></li>
<li>SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)- <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG">http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG</a></li>
</ul>
<h4>XUL</h4>

<p>The Keystone Application Framework partially implements XUL
(XML User Interface Language).  The specification for this may be seen at:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/xul/xul.html">http://www.mozilla.org/projects/xul/xul.html</a></p>

<p>This work falls under the Mozilla Public License, the terms of which may be
read <a href="reference/MPL-1.1.html">here</a></p>

<h3><a name="Software Works Included"></a>Software Works Included</h3>

The Keystone Application Framework uses several external software works which
are redistributed with the framework source.  Applications built with the
Keystone Application Framework must be released under the license terms of these
aggregate works.  All included works are published with licenses which do not
restrict free or commercial use.

<h4>Expat</h4>

<p>Expat (XML Parser Toolkit) is a free C Language XML parser written by
James Clark, officially Technical Lead on the W3C XML Working Group.  The
Expat parser is used and redistributed with the Keystone source.</p>
<p>The official site for the parser is
<a href="http://www.jclark.com/xml/expat.html">http://www.jclark.com/xml/expat.html</a><p>

<p>Expat is licensed (quote)</p>
<blockquote><i>Expat is freely available with source under a very liberal
<a href="reference/expat-copying.txt">license</a>
(the MIT license).</i></blockquote>

<h4>libPNG</h4>

<p>libPNG is a C library for reading and decoding the
PNG (Portable Network Graphics) image format.  libPNG is published with an
Open Source license, the terms of which may be read
<a href="reference/libpng-license.txt">here</a></p>

<p>
The Open Source libPNG license specifically permits use of the libPNG library
in commercial products without restriction.</p>

The PNG image format itself is designed to be open and freely implementable (quote)
<blockquote><i>
The PNG image format was designed in 1995 specifically in response to the patent
problems with the LZW algorithm used in GIF. To the best of the PNG group's
knowledge, PNG was then--and still is--completely patent-free</i></blockquote>

<h4>zlib</h4>

<p>
zlib is a data compression format and library used (amongst other things) by
the PNG image format.  zlib is used by libPNG, and therefor zlib is
redistributed along with libPNG in the Keystone Framework sources.</p>

<p>
zlib is released under a free software license the terms of which may be read
<a href="reference/zlib_license.html">here</a></p>

the license permits use of zlib in commercial products without restriction
(quote):
<blockquote><i>zlib is designed to be a free, general-purpose, legally
unencumbered -- that is, not covered by any patents -- lossless
data-compression library for use on virtually any computer hardware and
operating system</i></blockquote>

<h3><a name="Software Development Tools"></a>Software Development Tools</h3>

The Keystone Application framework uses the following development tools in
producing applications and documentation

<h4>C Compilers</h4>

Keystone and applications built with it are ultimately compiled into executable
code by a C compiler.  The following compilers are used:
<ul>
	<li>Microsoft Visual C Compiler (Win32)</li>
	<li>GNU C Compiler (Linux)</li>
</ul>

<p>Microsoft Visual C Compiler is a commercial product, and therefor a software
developer is required to have a purchased a copy or a of this to build software
for the Windows platform using the Keystone Application framework.  The
applications built with the compiler may be distributed on the
software developers own terms, within the scope of the LGPL license which
Keystone is released under.</p>

<p>the GNU C Compiler is published under the GPL Free Software license</p>

<h4>GNU Make</h4>

<p>GNU Make is required to build the framework and applications on all
platforms.  For the Win32 platform, GNU Make is redistributed with the
framework</p>

<h4>DOxygen Documentation System</h4>

<p>DOxygen is an automated documentation system for C/C++ source code.  The
Keystone Application framework API documentation is produced by DOxygen.</p>

The documentation created as the output of DOxygen is (quote):
<blockquote><i>
Documents produced by doxygen are derivative works derived from the input
used in their production; they are not affected by this license. [GPL]
</i></blockquote>

The official website for DOxygen is
